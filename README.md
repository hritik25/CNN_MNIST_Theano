# CNN.MNIST.Theano
Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (layer wise), using the python library <a href='http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/'>Theano</a> to understandand the basics of convolutions, filters, pooling. The CNN was then used to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

I have followed Michael Nelson's book, Michael A. Nielson, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Determination Press, 2015 (online version <a href='http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/'>here</a>) for learning about ANNs, CNNs and Deep Learning.
